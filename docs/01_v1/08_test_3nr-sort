Test Suite: Push_swap 3-Number Sort (/test/three)


Core Testing Requirements:

Verifies all 6 possible permutations of 3 numbers
Tests edge cases: NULL, single element
Validates memory handling (creation and cleanup)



Implementation Structure:

test.h - Minimal header with core declarations
test.c - Test implementation and helpers
main.c - Simple entry point
Makefile - Builds only required components



Test Output Design:

Shows input state -> output state
Immediate visual verification of correctness
No unnecessary formatting/complexity
Clear pass/fail indication per case



Test Helper Functions:

create_stack_three() - Specific to 3-number testing
print_stack() - Basic visualization
Memory management wrappers




Clearly shows test progress with numbered cases
Shows before/after state for each test
Provides visual pass/fail indicators
Returns proper exit code based on test results
