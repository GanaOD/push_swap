# Strategy:
	4 numbers: Find min, move it to top, push to B, sort 3, push back
	5 numbers: Find min twice, push both to B, sort 3, push both back

Operation counts:
	4 numbers: ~5-7 operations
	5 numbers: ~8-12 operations



# Testing:
Unified into existing test suite: now extended to "small"
	Test infrastructure (creating stacks, verification) can be shared
	Easier to run all small number tests at once



## changes and additions:

Unified test structure:
	All small number tests in one place
	Shared helper functions (create_stack_n, verify_sorted)
	Separate test functions for 3, 4, and 5 numbers


New test cases:
	Added comprehensive tests for 4 and 5 numbers
	Each size has its own test function for clarity
	All tests use the same verification infrastructure
