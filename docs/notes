# Fundamental structure:

## Core Mathematical Properties:

We have a sequence that needs to be transformed into ascending order
Our operations are all reversible (each has an inverse)

Operations either:
a) Swap adjacent elements within a stack (sa, sb)
b) Transfer elements between stacks (pa, pb)
c) Rotate elements within a stack (ra, rb, rra, rrb)


## Key Insight:
The most powerful feature here is having two stacks. This isn't just about sorting - it's about using the second stack as a structured auxiliary space
