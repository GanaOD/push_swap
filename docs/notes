# Fundamental structure:

## Core Mathematical Properties:

We have a sequence that needs to be transformed into ascending order
Our operations are all reversible (each has an inverse)

Operations either:
a) Swap adjacent elements within a stack (sa, sb)
b) Transfer elements between stacks (pa, pb)
c) Rotate elements within a stack (ra, rb, rra, rrb)


## Key Insight:
The most powerful feature here is having two stacks. This isn't just about sorting - it's about using the second stack as a structured auxiliary space




how numbers naturally stack:
	When we push numbers onto a stack, newer numbers sit on top of older ones
	When we pop numbers off, we get them in reverse order
	A stack inherently creates a LIFO (Last In First Out) relationship

pattern that emerges:
	Stack B isn't just temporary storage
	It can be used to create an ordered sequence that, when transferred back to A, naturally yields our desired order
	Rather than trying to sort directly in Stack A, we can use Stack B to "pre-sort"

an approach working from first principles:
	Any number pushed to B should be placed so it maintains a descending order
	When returning numbers to A, they'll naturally come back in ascending order
	The key question becomes: "What's the most efficient way to maintain this ordered structure in B?"



# Considering mathematical framework:

## Pure Mathematical Level (Position Theory):

Stack B's ideal state is a descending ordered sequence
For any number n being moved from A to B:
	It has a theoretically "correct" position in B's descending order
	This position is determined purely by B's current values and n
	This is a static, structural property independent of how we get there
Mathematically this is about partial orders and insertion points


## Operational Mathematical Level (Move Optimization):
Given a desired position for n in Stack B
And our current stack configurations
What sequence of our allowed operations (sa,sb,pa,pb,ra,rb,rr,rra,rrb,rrr)
Minimizes total moves to achieve that position?
This is about paths through the operation space


## The connection:
The first level tells us WHERE each number should go (the "what")
The second level tells us HOW to get it there (the "how")
Together they form a complete mathematical framework


## simple concrete example:

For number n going to Stack B:


Theoretical position determination:

	If B = [7,5,3,1] and n = 4
	Pure math says: 4 belongs between 5 and 3
	This is a purely structural property


Move optimization:

Current state: 
A = [4,...] (top)
B = [7,5,3,1]

To get 4 between 5 and 3:
- Need to rotate B once (rb)
- Then push 4 (pb)
OR
- Need to rotate B reverse twice (rrb,rrb)
- Then push 4 (pb)


The mathematical connection:
	First level gives us target state T
	Second level gives us shortest path P from current state C to T
	Both are necessary for a complete solution




# Quick practical mathematical framework:


For any number n moving A->B:
	Target position = where n belongs in B's descending order
	Cost = min(operations needed to get both stacks ready for this insertion)


For each move we evaluate:
	Cost to position A (rotations needed in A to get number to top)
	Cost to position B (rotations needed in B to get ready for insertion)
	Can we optimize by doing rotations simultaneously? (rr or rrr)



Implementation phases:

Core Structure Phase
	Stack implementation
	Basic operations (sa,sb,pa,pb etc.)
	Input parsing and error handling


Algorithm Phase
	Small sort (2-3 numbers) special cases
	Main sort:
	a) Push initial numbers to B maintaining descending order
	b) Calculate costs for each potential move
	c) Execute cheapest move
	d) Return numbers to A
