# key considerations for the next level of detail:

## 1. The "push to B" phase:

// Could be optimized by maintaining some order in B
// But even basic implementation should work:

void push_to_b(t_stack **a, t_stack **b)
{
    while (ft_lstsize(*a) > 3)
        pb(a, b);
}


## 2. The critical 3-number sort:

void sort_three(t_stack **a)
{
    int first = (*a)->nbr;
    int second = (*a)->next->nbr;
    int third = (*a)->next->next->nbr;
    
    // Will need exactly 6 cases to handle
    // Example case:
    if (first > second && second < third && first < third)
        sa(a);
}


## 3. The merge-back strategy needs careful thought:

int find_best_number(t_stack *b)
{
    // Need to consider:
    // - Distance from top for each number
    // - Whether rotation or reverse rotation is better
    // - Position it needs to go to in A
}



## Potential next steps:
Define stack structure
Implement basic stack operations
Build the three-number sort (this is a core building block)
