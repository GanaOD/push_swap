# Key considerations

nature of the problem:
	not just sorting numbers - choreographing a dance between two stacks
	goal isn't just to sort, but to do so with the minimum number of moves
	Stack B serves as an auxiliary space, but also as a staging area for building the sorted result

mathematical core:
	This is fundamentally about finding optimal paths through a state space
	Each operation represents an edge in a graph where nodes are stack states
	The challenge is finding the shortest path from initial state to sorted state


# Fundamental structure:

## Core Mathematical Properties:

We have a sequence that needs to be transformed into ascending order
Our operations are all reversible (each has an inverse)

Operations either:
a) Swap adjacent elements within a stack (sa, sb)
b) Transfer elements between stacks (pa, pb)
c) Rotate elements within a stack (ra, rb, rra, rrb)


## Key Insight:
The most powerful feature here is having two stacks. This isn't just about sorting - it's about using the second stack as a structured auxiliary space




how numbers naturally stack:
	When we push numbers onto a stack, newer numbers sit on top of older ones
	When we pop numbers off, we get them in reverse order
	A stack inherently creates a LIFO (Last In First Out) relationship

pattern that emerges:
	Stack B isn't just temporary storage
	It can be used to create an ordered sequence that, when transferred back to A, naturally yields our desired order
	Rather than trying to sort directly in Stack A, we can use Stack B to "pre-sort"





From pure mathematical/algorithmic foundations, what are our core options?

Direct Stack Manipulation Approaches:
	01_approach: (using B as descending auxiliary)
	Insertion sort variants
	Selection sort variants
	Bubble sort variants adapted for two stacks


More Sophisticated Possibilities:
	Quicksort adaptation (using B for partitioning)
	Merge sort adaptation (using B for merging)
	Radix sort adaptation (mentioned in notes but noted won't give full marks)


State Space Search Approaches:
	A* search with heuristics
	Dynamic programming for optimal submoves
	Pattern-based approaches (identifying and solving subpatterns)


Each has different theoretical properties:

Approach         Time Complexity    Operation Count    Implementation Complexity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Student A's      O(nÂ²)             Medium-High        Medium
Quick-adapt      O(n log n)        Varies            High
Merge-adapt      O(n log n)        High              High
State Space      O(n!)             Optimal           Very High



Different aspects:
	Pure mathematical elegance
	Operation count optimization
	Implementation simplicity
	Room for creative optimization
